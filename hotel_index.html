    <h3>Indian Cuisine</h3>
    <p>
      Indian cuisine encompasses a wide variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to India.
      Given the range of diversity in soil type, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines
      vary significantly from each other and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits.
      Indian food is also heavily influenced by religious and cultural choices and traditions. Also, Middle Eastern
      and Central Asian influences have occurred on North Indian cuisine from the years of Mughal rule.
      Indian cuisine is still evolving, as a result of the nation's cultural interactions with other societies.

                  During the 19th century, many Odia cooks were employed in Bengal and they took several dishes with them. Bengali cuisine is the only traditionally developed multi-course tradition from the Indian subcontinent that is analogous in structure to the modern service Ã  la russe style of French cuisine, with food served course-wise rather than all at once. Bengali cuisine differs according to regional tastes, such as the emphasis on the use of chilli pepper in the Chittagong district of Bangladesh[120] However, across all its varieties, there is predominant use of mustard oil along with large amounts of spices.
